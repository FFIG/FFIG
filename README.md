# Description

FFIG is a Foreign Function Interface Generator.

This project uses libclang to read existing C++ class definitions and create
equivalent classes in other languages (primarily Python for now) and binds them
to the C++ implementation.

While similar to SWIG, <http://www.swig.org>, FFIG does not need an interface
generation language to be used nor do the bindings it generates depend on any
binary details of an interpreter. FFIG Python bindings will run on PyPy,
Python2 Python3 without requiring changes.

FFIG is in early development. We welcome feedback from users but would
encourage anyone looking to generate language bindings to look at SWIG.


# Setup (Linux and macOS)

You will need libclang 3.8 and clang python bindings.

libclang can be installed from homebrew on mac or here: <http://llvm.org/releases/>

You can use pip to install python bindings for libclang:

`pip install clang version==3.8`

Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so that libclang can be found.

Update submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.


# Setup (Windows)

Untested, minor issues expected.


## Submodules
Tests use the 'catch' test framework: <https://github.com/philsquared/Catch.git>

To get the submodule run:

```
git submodule update --init
```


## Building
The build uses cmake driven by a simple Python script. To build and run tests, run the following from the console:

```
./scripts/build.py --tests
```

# Issues

Please raise github issues if code cannot be generated where expected or if generated code does not behave as expected.


# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome, please look at unassigned github issues or raise issues for suggested improvements.


# Attribution

I've made considerable use of the following in putting this together:

* <http://szelei.me/code-generator>
* <http://blog.glehmann.net/2014/12/29/Playing-with-libclang>
* <http://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/llvm-clang>

Design of the python bindings is taken from clang's cindex.

Mistakes are my own.
